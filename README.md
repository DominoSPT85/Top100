# Billboard HITS!

<p>This is a class project, to build a Billboard Top Hits app with Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>Basic Objectives:</p>

<li>Create a new rails app and make sure you make it a git repo and have a github repo linked to it</li>
<li>Billboard Model - top 100 us, top 100 euro, top 50, ect...</li>
<li>Artist Model - has_many songs</li>
<li>Song Model - belongs_to artist, belongs_to billboard (HINT: since Rails 5 you'll need to use optional: true on your association because a song is not always going to belong to a billboard) - http://blog.bigbinary.com/2016/02/15/rails-5-makes-belong-to-association-required-by-default.html (Links to an external site.)</li>
<li>All CRUD actions for each model</li>
<l.>Fill out the views</li>
<li>This is going to use nested routes for easier use of controller data flow</li>
 </ul>

<p>Bonus Objectives:</p>
<li>Style it to make it look professional, use Bootstrap, Materialize, Foundation, Semantic UI, Etc...</li>
<li>Add any other models that you see fit to make it a more robust application</li>
<li>Have the ability to play/preview the songs (there are many gems out there that let you interact with iTunes or Spotify or Soundcloud)</li>
<li>DRY up any code and do a full refactor of anything to make the code the cleanest you can</li>
<li>Ability to move song up or down a Billboard</li>
</ul>
